    <h2>Davido</h2>
    <p>Hello Everyone!</p>
    <p>My name is David, I'm also known to some people, especially freinds, as Davido(My nickname), I happen to share that nickname with a popular musician in my country.</p>
    <p>I am currently studying for a degree in Applied Technology.</p>
    <p>I like to read, write, watch wild life and science documentaries and do stuffs that challenge my abilities outside my comfort zone. I also like to play football, walk at the beach and spend time with my family.</p>
    <p>Marriage? I am not yet married but hope to do so in the not so distant future.</p>
    <p>Currently, I work as a freelance Digital Marketer and Graphic Designer.I like my job because it allows me to explore my creative side and also gives me the freedom to do other things I have interest in. </p>
    <p> From this course, I hope to be able to deepen my understanding of the principles of website development and improve my skill set with the information I gather along the way. At the conclusion of my degree or along the way, I intend to get better employment or working opportunities from the things I learn. I also intend to teach others and impart of my knowledge in the field to as many as I possibly can.</p>
    <p> I have been a member of the church for approximately 21years now. One of my favorite quote from a chuch leader was by President Thomas S Monson "Decisions determine destiny". Understanding this teaching, implies that I have a responsibility to determine who I want to be by the decission I make. Hence, there is a need to always choose the right. My favourite sciprture is from the Book of Mormon, Ether 12:27.</p>
    <p> My goal in life is to be happy.
